## Part A

### Everyday Interactions

### Ian

1. **Google Maps** – It is easy to search up addresses (if the addresses or business name is known), as the first thing you see at the top of the screen is a “Search here” input. Searching up institutions like the U of M can be more challenging as there are many addresses under the name “U of M”, and finding the right address could take some prior knowledge of the app. Using the app to get directions and understanding it calculates travel time based on mode of transport is useful but require some knowledge of where to find the buttons and how the app works. Overall, it is a very useful tool but requires the user to learn the system as there are a plethora of menus and options. 

2. **Phone Text App** – To access the text app there is a little button on the main screen with a picture of a text bubble. The app either opens to your current active chat or most recent active chats depending on if a text string was left open. There is a useful “Start chat” button at the bottom right of the screen, which is good for starting a chat with a person in the contact list. Also, the search at the top is useful for finding older chat chains not on the main screen. Overall, an easy-to-use app. 

3. **Swivel Office Chair** - The office chair allows many parts to be adjusted. It allows the seat to be titled forward and back, up and down, the back rest to be flexible or stiff, and the arm rest to be wide or narrow, and up and down. The many options are great for customizing the chair and make it great for finding the rights setting for maximal comfort. But the many knobs and levers used to do this make it difficult to figure out which control is for what setting, which makes the experience when adjusting the chair frustrating. 

4. **Umlearn** – This is a web portal where I can access all the course materials for each class. It has easy dropdown menus to access each class, and displaying the current class being viewed at the top is helpful. Accessing the course materials can usually be easily accessed in a sidebar (Instructor dependent). Overall, it matches my expectations for how it should function. I have used it for several years at this point, which could contribute to its ease of use. 

5. **Door Handle** – The door to exit the house has a turn style door handle. The handle itself is the rounded cone shaped style with a flat face. Turning the handle left or right moves the latch bolt, which allows the user to open the door. It turns easily, allowing the user to easily open the door. The design of the handle itself could be improved by making the handle a lever, which is easier to grip and turn, compared to the cone shaped design. 

6. **Alarm Clock** – An app located on my phone is used as my alarm clock. I have set it to play a soothing melody, so my wake up is not harsh. It plays the melody at the scheduled time, which is good. But it is easy to turn off the alarm, as it displays the buttons to stop the alarm as soon as it starts. This leads to instances where I have turned off my alarm without fully waking up. Overall, it performs as expected, but possibly making the stop button harder to access would be ideal. 

7. **Kettle** – The Kettle is a simple design. It contains a small oval transparent window, with volumetric measurements over top, and an up/down switch that toggles the kettle on/off. The simple design makes it easy to use. The switch is resting in the off position, making it easy to turn on, as it is just a press of the switch. It automatically turns off when the process is complete, so the user does not have to think about that. Overall, a very good design from the user’s perspective, as it does what it is supposed to, and has an easy interface to learn. 

8. **Microwave Controls** – The microwave control panel contains 21 buttons. 6 buttons are for presets (defrost, popcorn, etc.), 10 are the numbers 0 -9, and there is stop/start and settings buttons. Cooking something by manually entering the time is easy and performs as expected. The presets are less clear, and with buttons like the defrost, there is a lot of trial and error to get something to defrost in the microwave easily. Overall, Manually entering in a time is reliable way to cook things, but the presets are mostly unused as it is unclear how or why they would be used. 

9. **Sink Faucet** – The sink faucet has a long-craned neck with to round handles. One for hot water and the other for cold water.  Some good design features are that the spout is long and facing down into the sink, so it is clear where the water is going, the handles are colour coded (red and blue) to indicate which is for hot and which is for cold. This colour coding feature relies on the prior knowledge from user, as red equals hot and blue equals cold is not necessarily intuitive. Overall, a simplistic design that does what it is supposed to, with only some prior knowledge needed. 

10. **Backpack** – The backpack has two main storage pouches that have two zippers each that can be used to close and open the pouch. There are also two open topped mesh pouches (one on either side) that can hold a mug or something similar. The main pouches are used to hold textbooks and laptops, and they do this quite well. The one pouch even contains a separate area to hold the laptop, restricting its movement in the bag. Overall, it is a good design. It holds everything as expected. The material is strong enough to hold several books and a laptop, the zippers ensure nothing falls out from the top.

1. **Automatic Soap Dispenser** – The automatic soap dispenser senses when my hands are near the sensor. It ensures consistent amount of soap so can avoid wasting and since the dispenser works without any contact, it helps me maintain hygiene in the public washroom. But sometimes, it might cause confusion where the sensor is so need to move hands around the dispenser to find the sensor.  

2. **Standing Desk** – The standing desk can be able to move up and down depending on how the user wants. The desk's height can be modified by pressing a button with an upper or down arrow sign, which makes it easy to recognize which button to press to manage the height. 

3. **Auto-Focus of Phone Camera** – When using a phone camera, it automatically focuses on the subject. This auto-focus function in a phone camera could ensure the quality of the photo without manually focusing it but at the same time, it might be inconvenient if the auto-focusing subject is not the part that the user wants to focus on.  

4. **School Vending Machines** – It helps me easy to grab snacks or drinks from vending machines without contacting a cashier. This saves my time by just selecting an item with a couple of buttons. But the bad feature I think is sometimes, I get confused about when to pay money (e.g., before selecting an item, or after selecting an item) and end up starting over from the beginning. It actually makes me confused that I refuse to use different vending machines that I haven’t tried yet.  

5. **Syrup pump** - Working as a barista, when customers ask for a quarter pump or half pump, it’s hard to measure the exact amount of syrup all the time.  

6. **Smart car parking auto unlock** – (for some smart cars with specific design or software..?) When putting the car in park, it’s convenient most of the time for the car to unlock the doors. However, there are times when you don’t want it to unlock perhaps for safety reasons but it will unlock upon parking anyway which can be annoying or dangerous. 

7. **Charging outlet** – some need all three plugs to plug into the wall and this makes it so that it can’t be plugged in upside down. Some of these charging blocks are very big and if not plugged into the bottom outlet but the top outlet, then it would block the bottom outlet. However, if you have two of these charging blocks, then you cannot utilize both outlets at the same time which is very annoying.  

8. **Elevator button undo** -  

9. **Apple pencil** – can't use it when charging  

10. **Calculator** -

1. **Mobile Phone** – The mobile phone interface allows users to interact with their device by displaying information in a user-friendly manner. It is a very successful interaction as mobile phones have become essential in daily life for many individuals. Basic functions are easily accessible like calling, texting, or browsing without needing prior experience. However, some advanced features might be hard to grasp without proper guidance or tips, which shows both the success and limitation of this design. 

2. **Typing on a Keyboard** - Typing on a keyboard is an interaction that most people find easy to learn. Its main function of having to type a key to input text is pretty straightforward even for first –time users. However, to become an expert in it where you can type without having to look at the keys and knowing the exact placement of each letter takes practice. This would be gained through repeated use such as typing documents or texting. This design is easy and accessible for beginners but requires practice to get to be an expert.

3. **Door Lock Codes** – Codes that lock doors are easy to use for everyone, whether a beginner, a novice or an expert. You input the right code and the door unlocks, pretty straightforward. However, a common issue is that once you enter a number, you can’t undo it without starting over. Mistakes happen frequently and when they do, this design flaw can be frustrating. This design is accessible, but this flaw shows a limitation on user experience.

This design is accessible, but this flaw shows a limitation on user experience.
5. 
Peggo card reader – works well, easy to use. You just tap your card, hear a beep and proceed but there are sometimes times when the reader incorrectly shows an insufficient balance, even though you have funds available on the card. The user has to repeatedly keep tapping until it acknowledges the fund on your card which could lead to frustration on the user part.


Whiteboard on zoom – You use this to simulate a physical board on your screen where users can view the board and contribute to it in real time. An error I noticed recently was when the user who's sharing the board zooms in or out, it also affects the view for every single person viewing the board. This could disrupt users who want to maintain their own zoom level.


Reversing a car – Reversing a car could be confusing for new drivers.  When driving a car forward, we know that turning the steering wheel right makes the car turn right, and turning it left makes the car turn left. However, when reversing, this becomes less clear as we get confused whether to turn the wheel right as we would when moving a car forward, or the opposite. It would take some experience for new drivers to understand how steering while reversing the car works. A workaround I use is relying on the rearview camera, the camera shows guiding lines that indicate where the car is going to move to base on how the steering wheel is turned, making it easier to understand.


Elevators in Uni – Some elevators at the uni have 2 buttons, one is “Main” and the other is “1”. The “Main” button refers to the main floors, while “1” refers to the basement. This can be confusing for users not familiar with the elevators, they might assume that “1” refers to the main floor, which is commonly considered as the first floor in most buildings.


Alarm volume on phone - setting an alarm on a phone is easy to do, and doesn’t take much effort for users to do.  However, for heavy sleepers the maximum volume of the alarm clock on a phone might not be loud enough to wake them up


7. **Peggo card reader** – sometimes doesn’t read the card correctly and still beeps that you have insufficient funds even when you do

1. **Electric Milk Frother** - The device allows users to create froth or foam in milk. I use it to make froth in my coffee my main purpose is to just mix coffee, milk and sugar well.It has very simple but effective user interface and I find it to be very successful. It only has one button and pushing that button starts the frother which then can be used to do the thing we want it to.

2. **Microwave Controls** - Microwave device is used by the users to warm up their food. Microwave control panels differ in all microwaves but the one which I use involves a good interface. It has several buttons, each for different types of features and also button which we need to click in order to start microwave for 30 seconds. I feel that even though this interface is good, it is not successful because most of the time I use only the '30 seconds' button and ignore all others like they never existed.

3. **Push to open door Button (For disabled people)** - A button used by disabled people to open the door. This is the interface which I consider to be the most successful till date as it is not only ued by disabled people but normal people have also identified a way to reduce stress on their hand while opening door. People just like to click a button and door opens up itself. Moreover,

4. **Laptop Trackpad** - A laptop trackpad is a convenient device used to scroll select and do things on the laptop. Not only me but I guess everyone finds it useful and successful. In comparison to mouse we look that this interface is a bit confusing but it makes scrolling and clicks very easy for us.

5. **Elevator Button** - Elevator button is a regular thing which we don't even realise while using it. It has two interface one outside of elevator and the other inside the elevator. Both the interfaces are very simple and outstanding. It is as simple that if we click up the elevator comes to pick you and goes to the floor number which you click on the inner interface and it is vice versa for the down button. It is very simple and effective.

6. **Door Handle** - There are several types of door handles. The ones I am used to are the long ones which require us to push down and the door gets unlocked. It is successful in the sense that pushing it just opens the door very easily. It also has a small button below the handle by pushing which we can easily lock the door and to unlock the door we just need to push it down from inside of room.

7. **Amazon** - It is an e-commerce website as well as an application for phones. I usually use it in phone. This app has easy interface to search things which I want to search where as I can easily track my orders as well as see details of all orders. Moreover, while viewing a product it is very easy to find detailed specifications of the product. Overall, it is very useful and matches my expectations.

8. **Playstation Remote** -  Playstation remote is useful to play games in playstation. It is a bit complex interface for the newbies but once a person gets used to it, it feels very comfortable. It has several buttons which differ in functionality as per the game. Also it is made in a way that it fits in between both hands easily. Overall, I think it is a good interface but not a very successful one as person who wants to play has to give time to become comfortable with it.

9. **Apple Watch** - Apple watch is a smart watch which gets connected to our apple smartphone. It has two buttons as hard interface whereas touch controls as soft interface. Touch controls are very easy as they do what they say. Moreover it easily gets our data and can measure our heart rate also, canprovide some health analysis details. The watch is a very well made interface as per my expectations.

10. **iPhone 15 Pro Action Button** This button is a very good interface which helps us do several tasks as set in our settings by just long pressing it. The haptics it provides helps a lot to understand it's functionality. I feel that this is a very successful interface created by Apple.
