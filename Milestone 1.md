# Part A

## Everyday Interactions

### Ian

1. **Google Maps** – It is easy to search up addresses (if the addresses or business name is known), as the first thing you see at the top of the screen is a “Search here” input. Searching up institutions like the U of M can be more challenging as there are many addresses under the name “U of M”, and finding the right address could take some prior knowledge of the app. Using the app to get directions and understanding it calculates travel time based on mode of transport is useful but require some knowledge of where to find the buttons and how the app works. Overall, it is a very useful tool but requires the user to learn the system as there are a plethora of menus and options. 

2. **Phone Text App** – To access the text app there is a little button on the main screen with a picture of a text bubble. The app either opens to your current active chat or most recent active chats depending on if a text string was left open. There is a useful “Start chat” button at the bottom right of the screen, which is good for starting a chat with a person in the contact list. Also, the search at the top is useful for finding older chat chains not on the main screen. Overall, an easy-to-use app. 

3. **Swivel Office Chair** - The office chair allows many parts to be adjusted. It allows the seat to be titled forward and back, up and down, the back rest to be flexible or stiff, and the arm rest to be wide or narrow, and up and down. The many options are great for customizing the chair and make it great for finding the rights setting for maximal comfort. But the many knobs and levers used to do this make it difficult to figure out which control is for what setting, which makes the experience when adjusting the chair frustrating. 

4. **Umlearn** – This is a web portal where I can access all the course materials for each class. It has easy dropdown menus to access each class, and displaying the current class being viewed at the top is helpful. Accessing the course materials can usually be easily accessed in a sidebar (Instructor dependent). Overall, it matches my expectations for how it should function. I have used it for several years at this point, which could contribute to its ease of use. 

5. **Door Handle** – The door to exit the house has a turn style door handle. The handle itself is the rounded cone shaped style with a flat face. Turning the handle left or right moves the latch bolt, which allows the user to open the door. It turns easily, allowing the user to easily open the door. The design of the handle itself could be improved by making the handle a lever, which is easier to grip and turn, compared to the cone shaped design. 

6. **Alarm Clock** – An app located on my phone is used as my alarm clock. I have set it to play a soothing melody, so my wake up is not harsh. It plays the melody at the scheduled time, which is good. But it is easy to turn off the alarm, as it displays the buttons to stop the alarm as soon as it starts. This leads to instances where I have turned off my alarm without fully waking up. Overall, it performs as expected, but possibly making the stop button harder to access would be ideal. 

7. **Kettle** – The Kettle is a simple design. It contains a small oval transparent window, with volumetric measurements over top, and an up/down switch that toggles the kettle on/off. The simple design makes it easy to use. The switch is resting in the off position, making it easy to turn on, as it is just a press of the switch. It automatically turns off when the process is complete, so the user does not have to think about that. Overall, a very good design from the user’s perspective, as it does what it is supposed to, and has an easy interface to learn. 

8. **Microwave Controls** – The microwave control panel contains 21 buttons. 6 buttons are for presets (defrost, popcorn, etc.), 10 are the numbers 0 -9, and there is stop/start and settings buttons. Cooking something by manually entering the time is easy and performs as expected. The presets are less clear, and with buttons like the defrost, there is a lot of trial and error to get something to defrost in the microwave easily. Overall, Manually entering in a time is reliable way to cook things, but the presets are mostly unused as it is unclear how or why they would be used. 

9. **Sink Faucet** – The sink faucet has a long-craned neck with to round handles. One for hot water and the other for cold water.  Some good design features are that the spout is long and facing down into the sink, so it is clear where the water is going, the handles are colour coded (red and blue) to indicate which is for hot and which is for cold. This colour coding feature relies on the prior knowledge from user, as red equals hot and blue equals cold is not necessarily intuitive. Overall, a simplistic design that does what it is supposed to, with only some prior knowledge needed. 

10. **Backpack** – The backpack has two main storage pouches that have two zippers each that can be used to close and open the pouch. There are also two open topped mesh pouches (one on either side) that can hold a mug or something similar. The main pouches are used to hold textbooks and laptops, and they do this quite well. The one pouch even contains a separate area to hold the laptop, restricting its movement in the bag. Overall, it is a good design. It holds everything as expected. The material is strong enough to hold several books and a laptop, the zippers ensure nothing falls out from the top. 

### Heejeong

1. **Automatic Soap Dispenser** – The automatic soap dispenser senses when my hands are near the sensor. It ensures consistent amount of soap so can avoid wasting and since the dispenser works without any contact, it helps me maintain hygiene in the public washroom. But sometimes, it might cause confusion where the sensor is so need to move hands around the dispenser to find the sensor.  

2. **Standing Desk** – The standing desk can be able to move up and down depending on how the user wants. The desk's height can be modified by pressing a button with an upper or down arrow sign, which makes it easy to recognize which button to press to manage the height. 

3. **Auto-Focus of Phone Camera** – When using a phone camera, it automatically focuses on the subject. This auto-focus function in a phone camera could ensure the quality of the photo without manually focusing it but at the same time, it might be inconvenient if the auto-focusing subject is not the part that the user wants to focus on.  

4. **School Vending Machines** – It helps me easy to grab snacks or drinks from vending machines without contacting a cashier. This saves my time by just selecting an item with a couple of buttons. But the bad feature I think is sometimes, I get confused about when to pay money (e.g., before selecting an item, or after selecting an item) and end up starting over from the beginning. It makes me confused that I refuse to use different vending machines that I haven’t tried yet.  

5. **Syrup pump** - Working as a barista, when customers ask for a quarter pump or half pump, it’s hard to measure the exact amount of syrup all the time.  The pumps are designed for full portions, so trying to dispense smaller amounts often leads to inconsistent servings, which can affect the flavour balance of the drink. 

6. **Smart car parking auto unlocks** – In some smart cars when you put the car in park. The doors automatically unlock. While this is convenient in most situations, there are times when you don’t want the doors to unlock, such as in unsafe areas or when waiting inside the car. However, the car unlocks automatically regardless, which can be frustrating or even pose a safety risk.  

7. **Charging outlet** – some need all three plugs to plug into the wall and this makes it so that it can’t be plugged in upside down. Some of these charging blocks are very big and if not plugged into the bottom outlet but the top outlet, then it would block the bottom outlet. However, if you have two of these charging blocks, then you cannot utilize both outlets at the same time which is very annoying.  

8. **Elevator button undo** - Once you press a button for a floor, there is no option to undo or cancel that choice. This is inconvenient when you accidentally press the wrong button, as you either have to stop on the wrong floor or make someone else wait.  

9. **Apple pencil** – The Apple Pencil cannot be used while charging. When the battery runs out, I wait until it recharges enough to use it again, which interrupts my workflow.  

10. **Calculator** - Some calculators, especially on smartphones, have unclear or hidden functions, making them difficult to use. Features like advanced mathematical operations (e.g., square roots, exponents, or scientific notation) are often hidden within a secondary function, which isn’t always obvious to the user. This leads to confusion or the need to search for instructions.  

### Faiza

1. **Mobile Phone** – The mobile phone interface allows users to interact with their device by displaying information in a user-friendly manner. It is a very successful interaction as mobile phones have become essential in daily life for many individuals. Basic functions are easily accessible like calling, texting, or browsing without needing prior experience. However, some advanced features might be hard to grasp without proper guidance or tips, which shows both the success and limitation of this design. 

2. **Typing on a Keyboard** - Typing on a keyboard is an interaction that most people find easy to learn. Its main function of having to type a key to input text is pretty straightforward even for first –time users. However, to become an expert in it where you can type without having to look at the keys and knowing the exact placement of each letter takes practice. This would be gained through repeated use such as typing documents or texting. This design is easy and accessible for beginners but requires practice to get to be an expert.

3. **Door Lock Codes** – Codes that lock doors are easy to use for everyone, whether a beginner, a novice or an expert. You input the right code and the door unlocks, pretty straightforward. However, a common issue is that once you enter a number, you can’t undo it without starting over. Mistakes happen frequently and when they do, this design flaw can be frustrating. This design is accessible, but this flaw shows a limitation on user experience.
 
4. **Peggo card reader** – works well, easy to use. You just tap your card, hear a beep and proceed but there are sometimes times when the reader incorrectly shows an insufficient balance, even though you have funds available on the card. The user has to repeatedly keep tapping until it acknowledges the fund on your card which could lead to frustration on the user part.

5. **Whiteboard on zoom** – You use this to simulate a physical board on your screen where users can view the board and contribute to it in real time. An error I noticed recently was when the user who's sharing the board zooms in or out, it also affects the view for every single person viewing the board. This could disrupt users who want to maintain their own zoom level.

6. **Reversing a car** – Reversing a car could be confusing for new drivers.  When driving a car forward, we know that turning the steering wheel right makes the car turn right, and turning it left makes the car turn left. However, when reversing, this becomes less clear as we get confused whether to turn the wheel right as we would when moving a car forward, or the opposite. It would take some experience for new drivers to understand how steering while reversing the car works. A workaround I use is relying on the rearview camera, the camera shows guiding lines that indicate where the car is going to move to base on how the steering wheel is turned, making it easier to understand.

7. **Elevators in University** – Some elevators at the uni have 2 buttons, one is “Main” and the other is “1”. The “Main” button refers to the main floors, while “1” refers to the basement. This can be confusing for users not familiar with the elevators, they might assume that “1” refers to the main floor, which is commonly considered as the first floor in most buildings. 

8. **Alarm volume on phone** - setting an alarm on a phone is easy to do, and doesn’t take much effort for users to do.  However, for heavy sleepers the maximum volume of the alarm clock on a phone might not be loud enough to wake them up

9. **Mouse** - The mouse is easy to use, anyone with no experience can get the idea of how to use it instantly. It’s a good design.

10.  **Umbrella** - This design protects a person from the rain. One downside I've noticed from some umbrella is that they’re not able to withstand strong winds which makes sense because the umbrella is meant to be a light object one should be able to carry anywhere. 

### Divy

1. **Electric Milk Frother** - The device allows users to create froth or foam in milk. I use it to make froth in my coffee my main purpose is to just mix coffee, milk and sugar well.It has very simple but effective user interface and I find it to be very successful. It only has one button and pushing that button starts the frother which then can be used to do the thing we want it to.

2. **Microwave Controls** - Microwave device is used by the users to warm up their food. Microwave control panels differ in all microwaves but the one which I use involves a good interface. It has several buttons, each for different types of features and also button which we need to click in order to start microwave for 30 seconds. I feel that even though this interface is good, it is not successful because most of the time I use only the '30 seconds' button and ignore all others like they never existed.

3. **Push to open door Button (For disabled people)** - A button used by disabled people to open the door. This is the interface which I consider to be the most successful till date as it is not only ued by disabled people but normal people have also identified a way to reduce stress on their hand while opening door. People just like to click a button and door opens up itself. Moreover,

4. **Laptop Trackpad** - A laptop trackpad is a convenient device used to scroll select and do things on the laptop. Not only me but I guess everyone finds it useful and successful. In comparison to mouse we look that this interface is a bit confusing but it makes scrolling and clicks very easy for us.

5. **Elevator Button** - Elevator button is a regular thing which we don't even realise while using it. It has two interface one outside of elevator and the other inside the elevator. Both the interfaces are very simple and outstanding. It is as simple that if we click up the elevator comes to pick you and goes to the floor number which you click on the inner interface and it is vice versa for the down button. It is very simple and effective.

6. **Door Handle** - There are several types of door handles. The ones I am used to are the long ones which require us to push down and the door gets unlocked. It is successful in the sense that pushing it just opens the door very easily. It also has a small button below the handle by pushing which we can easily lock the door and to unlock the door we just need to push it down from inside of room.

7. **Amazon** - It is an e-commerce website as well as an application for phones. I usually use it in phone. This app has easy interface to search things which I want to search where as I can easily track my orders as well as see details of all orders. Moreover, while viewing a product it is very easy to find detailed specifications of the product. Overall, it is very useful and matches my expectations.

8. **Playstation Remote** -  Playstation remote is useful to play games in playstation. It is a bit complex interface for the newbies but once a person gets used to it, it feels very comfortable. It has several buttons which differ in functionality as per the game. Also it is made in a way that it fits in between both hands easily. Overall, I think it is a good interface but not a very successful one as person who wants to play has to give time to become comfortable with it.

9. **Apple Watch** - Apple watch is a smart watch which gets connected to our apple smartphone. It has two buttons as hard interface whereas touch controls as soft interface. Touch controls are very easy as they do what they say. Moreover it easily gets our data and can measure our heart rate also, canprovide some health analysis details. The watch is a very well made interface as per my expectations.

10. **iPhone 15 Pro Action Button** This button is a very good interface which helps us do several tasks as set in our settings by just long pressing it. The haptics it provides helps a lot to understand it's functionality. I feel that this is a very successful interface created by Apple.

## Best 10
1. **Sink Faucet** – The sink faucet features circular handles and a long, crane-neck design. A separate one for cold and hot water.  Good design elements include the long, downward-facing spout that makes it obvious where the water is going into the sink and the color-coded (red and blue) handles that show which is for hot and which is for cold. This color-coding feature depends on the user's past knowledge because it's not always obvious that red is hot and blue is cold. Overall, a straightforward design that accomplishes its goals and requires minimal prior knowledge. 

 2. **Swivel Office Chair** - The office chair allows many parts to be adjusted. It allows the seat to be tilted forward and back, up and down, the back rest to be flexible  or stiff, and the arm rest to be wide or narrow, and up and down.  many options for customizing the chair are great and make it great for finding the rights setting for maximal comfort. But many knobs and levers used to do this make it difficult to figure out which control is for what setting, which makes the experience of adjusting the chair frustrating

 3. **Umlearn** – This is a web portal where I can access all the course materials for each class. It has easy dropdown menus to access each class, and displaying the current class being viewed at the top is helpful. Accessing the course materials can usually be easily accessed in a sidebar (Instructor dependent). Overall, it matches my expectations for how it should function. I have used it for several years at this point, which could contribute to its ease of use.

 4. **Syrup pump** - While working as a barista, when customers ask for a quarter pump or half pump, it’s hard to measure the exact amount of syrup all the time.  The pumps are designed for full portions, so trying to dispense smaller amounts often leads to inconsistent servings, which can affect the flavour balance of the drink. This makes me feel that this interface can be improved by making it dependent on the protion sizes required.
  
 5. **Automatic Soap Dispenser** – The automatic soap dispenser senses my hands when they are near the sensor. It ensures consistent amount of soap, so wasteage of soap can be avoided and since the dispenser works without any contact, it helps me maintain hygiene in the public washroom. But sometimes, it might cause confusion where the sensor is so we need to move hands around the dispenser to find the sensor which makes it hard to use. The interface here is good but there should be some kind of description of where the sensor is may make it very good.  

 6. **Whiteboard on zoom** – You use this to simulate a physical board on your screen where users can view the board and contribute to it in real time. An error I noticed recently was when the user who's sharing the board zooms in or out, it also affects the view for every single person viewing the board. This could disrupt users who want to maintain their own zoom level. This interface seems a quite wierd but I guess it can be improved by adding an option to zoom in or out as per personel preferences.

 7. **Door Lock Codes** – Codes that lock doors are easy to use for everyone, whether a beginner, a novice or an expert. You input the right code and the door unlocks, pretty straightforward. However, a common issue is that once you enter a number, you can’t undo it without starting over. Mistakes happen frequently and when they do, this design flaw can be frustrating. This design is accessible, but this flaw shows a limitation on user experience.

 8. **Electric Milk Frother** - The device allows users to create froth or foam in milk. I use it to make froth in my coffee my main purpose is to just mix coffee, milk and sugar well.It has very simple but effective user interface and I find it to be very successful. It only has one button and pushing that button starts the frother which then can be used to do the thing we want it to.

 9. **Playstation Remote** -  Playstation remote is useful to play games in playstation. It is a bit complex interface for the newbies but once a person gets used to it, it feels very comfortable. It has several buttons which differ in functionality as per the game. Also it is made in a way that it fits in between both hands easily. Overall, I think it is a good interface but not a very successful one as person who wants to play has to give time to become comfortable with it.

 10. **Undoing in elevator button** - When you press a button for a floor in an elevator, there’s no way to undo or cancel it. This can be annoying if you press the wrong button by accident, because you either have to stop at the wrong floor or make others wait. It’s even worse in busy buildings, where this mistake can cause delays. Having a cancel option would make things easier and save time for everyone. So, the interface of Elvator Button might be improved.
 
## Design Principle
 1. **Minimal Interaction Principle** : Interfaces which have minimalistic things to do are among the most successful database. This is because users do not get confused of what to do or maybe have very less things to interact with the interface so there's no option of choosing any other button.

 We see the minimalitic interface in the examples of the **Electric Milk Frother** (Best 10), **Push to open door Button (For disabled people)** (Divy's ideas), and **Peggo card reader**(Faiza's Idea). This things in common have only 1 button or switch which makes users operate them. This single button make the interface very simplistic. Simple designs make it very convinient and easy for the users to use the products and thus minimalistic interface seems to be a good one.

 2. **Mitigate User Error** : Mistakes could occur when interacting with an interface, so it's important to design an interface that lets users correct their errors easily.  A user should be able to correct their errors without any difficulty or frustration.

 Consider the “elevator buttons” or the “door lock code” examples from above. If a user presses the wrong elevator button or presses the wrong code while unlocking the door, a good interface should let them correct their mistake immediately. Unfortunately, it does not, once a wrong elevator button is pressed or the wrong input is pressed a user cannot undo it which can lead to frustration. A design that limits this error by allowing users to correct their mistake would improve the use of the system. 

 3. **Visual Cues Principle** :Using pictures or visual cues, such as icons, or colours, guide users through the interface without the need for excessive explanation. They help users understand what actions are possible, where to focus, or how the system responds to their input, making interactions more intuitive.

 In the case of the sink faucet, the colour-coded handles are a strong example of visual cues being used to guide the user. The red handle is for hot water and the blue handle is for cold water based on a widely understood colour convention. The combination of these visual cues makes the design functional and relatively easy to use, as long as the user is familiar with basic colour coding. 

 4. **Princple of Accessibility** : Making the interface as accessible as it could be for the use of people with disabilities. Like using braile scripts on the interface for blind people, using some kind of descriptive drawing to describe the usage for the deaf people operating\n the device.

 This things can be seen in **Elevator Buttons** (Divy's ideas), and **Push to open door button** (Divy's ideas). There are braile scripts printed on the elevator buttons so rhat blind people can easily identify the description on the button. Talking about the Push to open door button, it is a great thing developed for the help of people who have disabilities in walking or do not have much power to open door. So, while creating an interface we think that providing accessibility tools is a good thing to make people feel that they are included.

 5. **Ability to Learn** : How quickly new users can understand and use the interface effectively. The easier it is to learn to adapt to the system, the better the design. A system with consistent interactions and recognizable patterns will minimize the learnomg curve.

 The PlayStation remote is a good example of an interface with a moderate learnability curve. The multiple buttons can be overwhelming for new users. This complexity can hinder initial interactions, requiring the user to invest time to understand the button functions. However, once a user becomes familiar with the remote’s layout, the design becomes intuitive and easy to use across different games.  



# Part B: Observing Users 

## Part B.1: Website Description 

The site we have decided to use for our user observations is Toy’s r’ Us. This site was chosen for a few reasons. Firstly, we are considering doing an online store front for our high-fidelity prototype. Observing users use an online store will help us when it comes to time for us to make design decisions for our own prototype. Secondly, the demographic for online toy stores is quite large, as you will have young kids to adults potentially using the site to buy toys for themselves, or someone they know. This provides an interesting challenge, as the skill level of the user will be varied. Finally, Toy’s r’ Us is one of the largest companies dedicated to selling toys, so it seemed like the best option. 

## Part B.2: Tasks 

We choose tasks specifically tailored to an online store front. 

### Tasks

 1. Find with search bar – Use the search bar to find a toy that you would like to buy. 

 2. Find by navigation – Use the menus to explore the site to find a different toy you would like to buy. 

 3. Add to the cart – From the product description page, or a list, how easy is it to add the toy to the shopping cart. 
 
 4. Buy – Go through the process of buying the toy, from being in the cart to right before it is actually purchased. 

 

### Interviews 

### Participant 1 

The participant chose the pseudonym **"Lily"**, she is a 10-year-old female currently in grade 6. 

**Lily** had no issues completing most of the tasks, except for finding a specific toy using the navigation feature. The navigation element is a weak part in the interface, as **Lily** got stuck and needed additional help before she could locate a soccer ball. 

**Lily** mentioned that she liked that the website had a lot of toys available and thought the toys on the website looked “cool” considering she’s a kid. She also found the category section helpful. However, she did not like that she could not find the category section initially and needed help to find it 

### Participant 2 

Participant 2 chose the pseudonym **“Briella”**, she is a 17-year-old female currently in grade 12. 

**Briella** had no issues with completing most of the tasks, except for finding a specific toy using the navigation feature. She was initially confused about how to find an item without using the search function and just started clicking on random options that related to what she was searching for. She needed additional help before she could find a soccer ball. She was also confused on what the checkout options “deliver to store” or “deliver to home” meant. 

**Briella** mentioned she liked how straightforward the interface was after finding the category feature. However, she did not like how confusing it was initially to locate an item before location the category, and how the checkout had too many options. 

### Participant 3 

Participant 3 chose the pseudonym **“Olivia”**, she is a 27-year-old female currently working as a nurse. 

She found searching for an item, in this case a ‘Polly Pocket’. She found the item easily using the search ball. Looking for a soccer ball using the navigation bar took longer. The process took going through several navigation bars, to find the soccer balls. She initially had to stop and think for a minute about which link to click, of the broader categories before she could narrow the table down to soccer balls. Also, it took her an extra second to add an item to the shopping cart, as the site has two separate sections, one for instore pickup and another for delivery. There is no button explicitly labelled “add to cart”. Ordering the product was straightforward. 

Overall, she found the website ok to use. She found the search bar easy, and quick to use. The pauses noted while looking up at the soccer ball, and adding an item to the shopping were, were also things Olivia explained she disliked about the interface. Specifically, that it was not obvious right away how to complete those tasks. 

### Participant 4 

Participant 4, chose the pseudonym **“Kevin”**, is a 25-year-old male university student.  

**Kevin** had no trouble finding a toy, whether using the search bar or navigating through the site’s menus. While both methods worked for him, the search bar allowed him to find an item much faster compared to browsing the categories, which took longer but was still effective. When it came to adding an item to the cart, Kevin initially had no problem identifying where the button should be. However, after clicking on the item to view its description in more detail, he encountered difficulties locating the “Add to Cart” button. Through trial and error, he discovered that the “Home Delivery” button actually added the item to the cart, which he found unintuitive and frustrating. The checkout process, on the other hand, was straightforward. Kevin appreciated the multiple options for completing the purchase, including logging in, creating an account, or using guest checkout.  

Overall, **Kevin** felt it was relatively easy to find the toy he wanted. However, he was confused by the misleading “Home Delivery” button and mentioned that the site’s layout seemed disorganized, though it did not hinder his ability to find products.  

 

### Participant 5 

Participant 5 chose the nickname **‘Seven’** which was his favorite number. He is 21 years old and is a computer science student at the University of Manitoba.Moreover, he works as an associate at Walmart. 

**Seven** while doing his tasks of finding the toy was too fast probably because of his knowledge about toys due to his work at walmart. He easily searched and found the item, also he was comfortable with the menu method as well. For the 3rd task he found it very easy and praised the ‘Toys R’ Us’ website for having easy ‘Add to Cart’ feature. For the 4th task, he thought he would have to create a id to try to place an order but the website provided him a option for guest checkout which made his work less and he enjoyed placing an order. Moreover, he felt easiest while entering the address because when he typed his apartment number and street he got an option of the location and everything got auto filled. 
The thing he does not like was that the store showed pickup available for some items even when that item was available in nearby store but not in the selected store, so he concluded that as confusing. 

### Participant 6 

Participant 6 chose **‘Unknown’** as her nickname. She is roughly around 21-23 years old and is a computer science student at University of Manitoba. 

**‘Unknown’** when asked to complete her tasks, she found it pretty easy with all of the tasks. None of the tasks took more than a minute or 2 for her to complete and she was impressed with this easy interface, but she also suggested that how an option like buying the product directly instead of adding it to cart and then buying it was missing in the website. She feels that she can save a lot of time with their feature. Also, she hated the inconsistency of the display as there were lots of whitespace left on the sides ofwebsite window in the browser. So, she suggested that this could be mad consistent in all kinds of web browser. 

### Provide a half page summary discussion on what you learned from “Look”ing vs “Ask”ing, where these two approaches yielded similar insight, and where they differed. 

**“Looking”** provided a direct observation on how the user interacted with the interface. I noticed from looking that when users encountered an issue, they often paused or scanned the screen anxiously. This behavior shows a weak point in the interface design. 

**Asking** allowed me to understand what the user thought about the interface. Through asking, i gained more information about their thoughts or frustrations. Users expressed their confusion about some features which made me understand the issues they faced. 

The two approaches yielded similar insight as my observations of the struggles the user faces during the “Looking” was confirmed by the user's feedback during “Asking”. However, the two approaches differed in their focus. “Looking” focuses on real-time behavior while “Asking” provided more understanding of the user’s experience.
