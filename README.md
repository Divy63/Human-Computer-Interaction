# Toy Store Website

This project is a simple, interactive website for a toy store. The website helps users browse different toy categories, search for specific products, and use filters to narrow down results. It also includes a quiz to help users find suitable toys when theyâ€™re undecided.

## Features
- **Category Selection Map**: Interactive categories (e.g., Books & Comics, Outdoor, Electronics) displayed over a map image for easy browsing.
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to search for toys by name.
- **Filter Options**: Additional filters to help users refine their search by price, age range, and other criteria.
- **Responsive Design**: Layout adjusts for different screen sizes to ensure an optimal user experience on desktop of different sizes.
- **Try your Luck**: A game implemented in our website which is only available to the users who have at least one item added to the cart. In the game, you get to select any cards from a list of 4 cards, and you get a discount on one of the product, and then you can add it to cart as well and buy it.
    **Note:** If a user adds a toy to the cart and then plays try your luck game and gets that toy to the cart and wants to remove the previous toy then the toy that comes with try your luck game will also be removed.
- **Cart**: Items can be added to the cart using the "add to cart" icon button on a toy card. When you click on the "cart" icon in teh top right corner, users should be able to see all items added to the cart along with the total price.
